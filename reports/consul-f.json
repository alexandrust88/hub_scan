The earliest affected version is 3.6.3 (2018-07-16) because of an error in a 2017-10-06 commit. The DTLS client always uses 32 '\\0' bytes instead of a random value, and thus contributes no randomness to a DTLS negotiation. This breaks the security guarantees of the DTLS protocol.","Severity":"MEDIUM","References":["http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-04/msg00015.html","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-11501","https://gitlab.com/gnutls/gnutls/-/commit/5b595e8e52653f6c5726a4cdd8fddeb6e83804d2","https://gitlab.com/gnutls/gnutls/-/issues/960","https://www.debian.org/security/2020/dsa-4652","https://www.gnutls.org/security-new.html#GNUTLS-SA-2020-03-31"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"GNUTLS-SA-2020-03-31","PkgName":"gnutls","InstalledVersion":"3.6.7-r0","FixedVersion":"3.6.7-r1","Severity":"UNKNOWN"},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2016-4074","PkgName":"jq","InstalledVersion":"1.6-r0","FixedVersion":"1.6_rc1-r0","Title":"jq: stack exhaustion via jv_dump_term() function","Description":"The jv_dump_term function in jq 1.5 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (stack consumption and application crash) via a crafted JSON file.","Severity":"HIGH","References":["http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2016/04/24/3","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2016/04/24/4","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-4074","https://github.com/stedolan/jq/","https://github.com/stedolan/jq/issues/1136"]}]}
