For the Heap-Buffer-Overflow, Thread 2 is creating the size for a buffer, but Thread1 is already writing to the buffer without knowing how much to write.

Python versions prior to 2.7.14 may also be vulnerable and it appears that Python 2.7.17 and prior may also be vulnerable however this has not been confirmed. The vulnerability lies when multiply threads are handling large amounts of data. In both cases there is essentially a race condition that occurs. For the Heap-Buffer-Overflow, Thread 2 is creating the size for a buffer, but Thread1 is already writing to the buffer without knowing how much to write. So when a large amount of data is being processed, it is very easy to cause memory corruption using a Heap-Buffer-Overflow. As for the Use-After-Free, Thread3->Malloc->Thread1->Free's->Thread2-Re-uses-Free'd Memory. The PSRT has stated that this is not a security vulnerability due to the fact that the attacker must be able to run code, however in some situations, such as function as a service, this vulnerability can potentially be used by an attacker to violate a trust boundary, as such the DWF feels this issue deserves a

Specifically, this affects shadow 4.8 when compiled using --with-libpam but without explicitly passing --disable-account-tools-setuid, and without a PAM configuration suitable for use with setuid account management tools. This combination leads to account management tools (groupadd, groupdel, groupmod, useradd, userdel, usermod) that can easily be used by unprivileged local users to escalate privileges to root in multiple ways. This issue became much more relevant in approximately December 2019 when an unrelated bug was fixed (i.e., the chmod calls to suidusbins were fixed in the upstream Makefile which is now included in the release version 4.8).","Severity":"MEDIUM","References":["https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/64836","https://bugs.gentoo.org/702252","https://github.com/shadow-maint/shadow/commit/edf7547ad5aa650be868cf2dac58944773c12d75","https://github.com/shadow-maint/shadow/pull/199","https://github.com/void-linux/void-packages/pull/17580"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2013-4235","PkgName":"passwd","InstalledVersion":"1:4.4-4.1","Title":"shadow-utils: TOCTOU race conditions by copying and removing directory trees","Description":"shadow: TOCTOU (time-of-check time-of-use) race condition when copying and removing directory trees","Severity":"LOW","References":["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2013-4235","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2013-4235","https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-4235"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"TEMP-0628843-DBAD28","PkgName":"passwd","InstalledVersion":"1:4.4-4.1","Severity":"LOW"},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2011-4116","PkgName":"perl","InstalledVersion":"5.24.1-3+deb9u6","Title":"perl: File::Temp insecure temporary file handling","Description":"_is_safe in the File::Temp module for Perl does not properly handle symlinks.","Severity":"MEDIUM","References":["http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2011/11/04/2","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2011/11/04/4","https://github.com/Perl-Toolchain-Gang/File-Temp/issues/14","https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=69106","https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2011/q4/238"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2011-4116","PkgName":"perl-base","InstalledVersion":"5.24.1-3+deb9u6","Title":"perl: File::Temp insecure temporary file handling","Description":"_is_safe in the File::Temp module for Perl does not properly handle symlinks.","Severity":"MEDIUM","References":["http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2011/11/04/2","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2011/11/04/4","https://github.com/Perl-Toolchain-Gang/File-Temp/issues/14","https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=69106","https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2011/q4/238"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2011-4116","PkgName":"perl-modules-5.24","InstalledVersion":"5.24.1-3+deb9u6","Title":"perl: File::Temp insecure temporary file handling","Description":"_is_safe in the File::Temp module for Perl does not properly handle symlinks.","Severity":"MEDIUM","References":["http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2011/11/04/2","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2011/11/04/4","https://github.com/Perl-Toolchain-Gang/File-Temp/issues/14","https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=69106","https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2011/q4/238"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2008-4108","PkgName":"python","InstalledVersion":"2.7.13-2","Title":"python: Generic FAQ wizard moving tool insecure auxiliary /tmp file usage (symlink attack possible)","Description":"Tools/faqwiz/move-faqwiz.sh (aka the generic FAQ wizard moving tool) in Python 2.4.5 might allow local users to overwrite arbitrary files via a symlink attack on a tmp$RANDOM.tmp temporary file.
