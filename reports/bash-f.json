{"Target":"bash (alpine 3.11.5)","Vulnerabilities":[{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2020-6750","PkgName":"glib","InstalledVersion":"2.62.4-r0","FixedVersion":"2.62.5-r0","Title":"glib: Mishandling of proxy_addr field in GSocketClient may lead to proxy being ignored","Description":"GSocketClient in GNOME GLib through 2.62.4 may occasionally connect directly to a target address instead of connecting via a proxy server when configured to do so, because the proxy_addr field is mishandled. This bug is timing-dependent and may occur only sporadically depending on network delays. The greatest security relevance is in use cases where a proxy is used to help with privacy/anonymity, even though there is no technical barrier to a direct connection. NOTE: versions before 2.60 are unaffected.","Severity":"MEDIUM","References":["https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1160668","https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/issues/1989","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20200127-0001/"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2020-11501","PkgName":"gnutls","InstalledVersion":"3.6.10-r0","FixedVersion":"3.6.10-r1","Title":"gnutls: DTLS client hello contains a random value of all zeroes","Description":"GnuTLS 3.6.x before 3.6.13 uses incorrect cryptography for DTLS. The earliest affected version is 3.6.3 (2018-07-16) because of an error in a 2017-10-06 commit. The DTLS client always uses 32 '\\0' bytes instead of a random value, and thus contributes no randomness to a DTLS negotiation. This breaks the security guarantees of the DTLS protocol.","Severity":"MEDIUM","References":["http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-04/msg00015.html","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-11501","https://gitlab.com/gnutls/gnutls/-/commit/5b595e8e52653f6c5726a4cdd8fddeb6e83804d2","https://gitlab.com/gnutls/gnutls/-/issues/960","https://www.debian.org/security/2020/dsa-4652","https://www.gnutls.org/security-new.html#GNUTLS-SA-2020-03-31"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"GNUTLS-SA-2020-03-31","PkgName":"gnutls","InstalledVersion":"3.6.10-r0","FixedVersion":"3.6.10-r1","Severity":"UNKNOWN"}]}
