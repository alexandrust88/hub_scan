On Linux and other systems that support \"saved UID\" functionality, the saved UID is not dropped.

In those cases it is possible that such a group does not have the cofactor present. This can occur even where all the parameters match a known named curve. If such a curve is used then OpenSSL falls back to non-side channel resistant code paths which may result in full key recovery during an ECDSA signature operation. In order to be vulnerable an attacker would have to have the ability to time the creation of a large number of signatures where explicit parameters with no co-factor present are in use by an application using libcrypto. For the avoidance of doubt libssl is not vulnerable because explicit parameters are never used. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1d (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1c). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.0l (Affected 1.1.0-1.1.0k). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2t (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2s).","Severity":"LOW","References":["http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/154467/Slackware-Security-Advisory-openssl-Updates.html","https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01785","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-1547","https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=21c856b75d81eff61aa63b4f036bb64a85bf6d46","https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=30c22fa8b1d840036b8e203585738df62a03cec8","https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=7c1709c2da5414f5b6133d00a03fc8c5bf996c7a","https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/Sep/25","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20190919-0002/","https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20190910.txt"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2018-7169","PkgName":"passwd","InstalledVersion":"1:4.5-1ubuntu2","Title":"shadow-utils: newgidmap allows unprivileged user to drop supplementary groups potentially allowing privilege escalation","Description":"An issue was discovered in shadow 4.5. newgidmap (in shadow-utils) is setuid and allows an unprivileged user to be placed in a user namespace where setgroups(2) is permitted. This allows an attacker to remove themselves from a supplementary group, which may allow access to certain filesystem paths if the administrator has used \"group blacklisting\" (e.g., chmod g-rwx) to restrict access to paths. This flaw effectively reverts a security feature in the kernel (in particular, the /proc/self/setgroups knob) to prevent this sort of privilege escalation.","Severity":"MEDIUM","References":["https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/shadow/+bug/1729357","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201805-09"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2013-4235","PkgName":"passwd","InstalledVersion":"1:4.5-1ubuntu2","Title":"shadow-utils: TOCTOU race conditions by copying and removing directory trees","Description":"shadow: TOCTOU (time-of-check time-of-use) race condition when copying and removing directory trees","Severity":"LOW","References":["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2013-4235","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2013-4235","https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-4235"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2019-9923","PkgName":"tar","InstalledVersion":"1.29b-2ubuntu0.1","Title":"tar: null-pointer dereference in pax_decode_header in sparse.c","Description":"pax_decode_header in sparse.c in GNU Tar before 1.32 had a NULL pointer dereference when parsing certain archives that have malformed extended headers.","Severity":"MEDIUM","References":["http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/tar.git/commit/?id=cb07844454d8cc9fb21f53ace75975f91185a120","http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-04/msg00077.html","http://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?55369","https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/tar/+bug/1810241"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2018-20482","PkgName":"tar","InstalledVersion":"1.29b-2ubuntu0.1","Title":"tar: Infinite read loop in sparse_dump_region function in sparse.c","Description":"GNU Tar through 1.30, when --sparse is used, mishandles file shrinkage during read access, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (infinite read loop in sparse_dump_region in sparse.c) by modifying a file that is supposed to be archived by a different user's process (e.g., a system backup running as root).","Severity":"LOW","References":["http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/tar.git/commit/?id=c15c42ccd1e2377945fd0414eca1a49294bff454","http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-tar/2018-12/msg00023.html","http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-04/msg00077.html","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/106354","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-20482","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2018/12/msg00023.html","https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18745431","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201903-05","https://twitter.com/thatcks/status/1076166645708668928","https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/sysadmin/TarFindingTruncateBug"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2018-7738","PkgName":"util-linux","InstalledVersion":"2.31.1-0.4ubuntu3.5","Title":"util-linux: Shell command injection in unescaped bash-completed mount point names","Description":"In util-linux before 2.32-rc1, bash-completion/umount allows local users to gain privileges by embedding shell commands in a mountpoint name, which is mishandled during a umount command (within Bash) by a different user, as demonstrated by logging in as root and entering umount followed by a tab character for autocompletion.","Severity":"HIGH","References":["http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/103367","https://bugs.debian.org/892179","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-7738","https://github.com/karelzak/util-linux/commit/75f03badd7ed9f1dd951863d75e756883d3acc55","https://github.com/karelzak/util-linux/issues/539","https://www.debian.org/security/2018/dsa-4134"]}]}
