When libcurl connects to an FTP server and successfully logs in (anonymous or not), it asks the server for the current directory with the `PWD` command. The server then responds with a 257 response containing the path, inside double quotes. The returned path name is then kept by libcurl for subsequent uses. Due to a flaw in the string parser for this directory name, a directory name passed like this but without a closing double quote would lead to libcurl not adding a trailing NUL byte to the buffer holding the name. When libcurl would then later access the string, it could read beyond the allocated heap buffer and crash or wrongly access data beyond the buffer, thinking it was part of the path. A malicious server could abuse this fact and effectively prevent libcurl-based clients to work with it - the PWD command is always issued on new FTP connections and the mistake has a high chance of causing a segfault. The simple fact that this has issue remained undiscovered for this long could suggest that malformed PWD responses are rare in benign servers. We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw. This bug was introduced in commit [415d2e7cb7](https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/415d2e7cb7), March 2005.

Git uses external \"credential helper\" programs to store and retrieve passwords or other credentials from secure storage provided by the operating system. Specially-crafted URLs that contain an encoded newline can inject unintended values into the credential helper protocol stream, causing the credential helper to retrieve the password for one server (e.g., good.example.com) for an HTTP request being made to another server (e.g., evil.example.com), resulting in credentials for the former being sent to the latter. There are no restrictions on the relationship between the two, meaning that an attacker can craft a URL that will present stored credentials for any host to a host of their choosing. The vulnerability can be triggered by feeding a malicious URL to git clone. However, the affected URLs look rather suspicious; the likely vector would be through systems which automatically clone URLs not visible to the user, such as Git submodules, or package systems built around Git. The problem has been patched in the versions published on April 14th, 2020, going back to v2.17.x. Anyone wishing to backport the change further can do so by applying commit 9a6bbee (the full release includes extra checks for git fsck, but that commit is sufficient to protect clients against the vulnerability). The patched versions are: 2.17.4, 2.18.3, 2.19.4, 2.20.3, 2.21.2, 2.22.3, 2.23.2, 2.24.2, 2.25.3, 2.26.1.","Severity":"HIGH","References":["http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/157250/Git-Credential-Helper-Protocol-Newline-Injection.html","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2020/04/15/5","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-5260","https://github.com/git/git/commit/9a6bbee8006c24b46a85d29e7b38cfa79e9ab21b","https://github.com/git/git/security/advisories/GHSA-qm7j-c969-7j4q","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2020/04/msg00010.html","https://lore.kernel.org/git/xmqqy2qy7xn8.fsf@gitster.c.googlers.com/","https://www.debian.org/security/2020/dsa-4657"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2017-1000117","PkgName":"git","InstalledVersion":"1:2.1.4-2.1+deb8u2","FixedVersion":"1:2.1.4-2.1+deb8u4","Title":"git: Command injection via malicious ssh URLs","Description":"A malicious third-party can give a crafted \"ssh://...\" URL to an unsuspecting victim, and an attempt to visit the URL can result in any program that exists on the victim's machine being executed.

Git uses external \"credential helper\" programs to store and retrieve passwords or other credentials from secure storage provided by the operating system. Specially-crafted URLs that contain an encoded newline can inject unintended values into the credential helper protocol stream, causing the credential helper to retrieve the password for one server (e.g., good.example.com) for an HTTP request being made to another server (e.g., evil.example.com), resulting in credentials for the former being sent to the latter. There are no restrictions on the relationship between the two, meaning that an attacker can craft a URL that will present stored credentials for any host to a host of their choosing. The vulnerability can be triggered by feeding a malicious URL to git clone. However, the affected URLs look rather suspicious; the likely vector would be through systems which automatically clone URLs not visible to the user, such as Git submodules, or package systems built around Git. The problem has been patched in the versions published on April 14th, 2020, going back to v2.17.x. Anyone wishing to backport the change further can do so by applying commit 9a6bbee (the full release includes extra checks for git fsck, but that commit is sufficient to protect clients against the vulnerability). The patched versions are: 2.17.4, 2.18.3, 2.19.4, 2.20.3, 2.21.2, 2.22.3, 2.23.2, 2.24.2, 2.25.3, 2.26.1.","Severity":"HIGH","References":["http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/157250/Git-Credential-Helper-Protocol-Newline-Injection.html","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2020/04/15/5","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-5260","https://github.com/git/git/commit/9a6bbee8006c24b46a85d29e7b38cfa79e9ab21b","https://github.com/git/git/security/advisories/GHSA-qm7j-c969-7j4q","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2020/04/msg00010.html","https://lore.kernel.org/git/xmqqy2qy7xn8.fsf@gitster.c.googlers.com/","https://www.debian.org/security/2020/dsa-4657"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2017-1000117","PkgName":"git-man","InstalledVersion":"1:2.1.4-2.1+deb8u2","FixedVersion":"1:2.1.4-2.1+deb8u4","Title":"git: Command injection via malicious ssh URLs","Description":"A malicious third-party can give a crafted \"ssh://...\" URL to an unsuspecting victim, and an attempt to visit the URL can result in any program that exists on the victim's machine being executed.

When libcurl connects to an FTP server and successfully logs in (anonymous or not), it asks the server for the current directory with the `PWD` command. The server then responds with a 257 response containing the path, inside double quotes. The returned path name is then kept by libcurl for subsequent uses. Due to a flaw in the string parser for this directory name, a directory name passed like this but without a closing double quote would lead to libcurl not adding a trailing NUL byte to the buffer holding the name. When libcurl would then later access the string, it could read beyond the allocated heap buffer and crash or wrongly access data beyond the buffer, thinking it was part of the path. A malicious server could abuse this fact and effectively prevent libcurl-based clients to work with it - the PWD command is always issued on new FTP connections and the mistake has a high chance of causing a segfault. The simple fact that this has issue remained undiscovered for this long could suggest that malformed PWD responses are rare in benign servers. We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw. This bug was introduced in commit [415d2e7cb7](https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/415d2e7cb7), March 2005. In libcurl version 7.56.0, the parser always zero terminates the string but also rejects it if not terminated properly with a final double quote.","Severity":"MEDIUM","References":["http://www.debian.org/security/2017/dsa-3992","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/101115","http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1039509","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2486","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:3558","https://curl.haxx.se/673d0cd8.patch","https://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20171004.html","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-1000254","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201712-04","https://support.apple.com/HT208331"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2017-1000257","PkgName":"libcurl3","InstalledVersion":"7.38.0-4+deb8u5","FixedVersion":"7.38.0-4+deb8u7","Title":"curl: IMAP FETCH response out of bounds read","Description":"An IMAP FETCH response line indicates the size of the returned data, in number of bytes.

When libcurl connects to an FTP server and successfully logs in (anonymous or not), it asks the server for the current directory with the `PWD` command. The server then responds with a 257 response containing the path, inside double quotes. The returned path name is then kept by libcurl for subsequent uses. Due to a flaw in the string parser for this directory name, a directory name passed like this but without a closing double quote would lead to libcurl not adding a trailing NUL byte to the buffer holding the name. When libcurl would then later access the string, it could read beyond the allocated heap buffer and crash or wrongly access data beyond the buffer, thinking it was part of the path. A malicious server could abuse this fact and effectively prevent libcurl-based clients to work with it - the PWD command is always issued on new FTP connections and the mistake has a high chance of causing a segfault. The simple fact that this has issue remained undiscovered for this long could suggest that malformed PWD responses are rare in benign servers. We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw. This bug was introduced in commit [415d2e7cb7](https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/415d2e7cb7), March 2005.

The vulnerability lies when multiply threads are handling large amounts of data. In both cases there is essentially a race condition that occurs. For the Heap-Buffer-Overflow, Thread 2 is creating the size for a buffer, but Thread1 is already writing to the buffer without knowing how much to write. So when a large amount of data is being processed, it is very easy to cause memory corruption using a Heap-Buffer-Overflow. As for the Use-After-Free, Thread3->Malloc->Thread1->Free's->Thread2-Re-uses-Free'd Memory.

No EC algorithms are affected. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA and DSA as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not believed likely. Attacks against DH1024 are considered just feasible, because most of the work necessary to deduce information about a private key may be performed offline. The amount of resources required for such an attack would be significant. However, for an attack on TLS to be meaningful, the server would have to share the DH1024 private key among multiple clients, which is no longer an option since CVE-2016-0701. This only affects processors that support the AVX2 but not ADX extensions like Intel Haswell (4th generation).

Due to the low severity of this issue we are not issuing a new release of OpenSSL 1.1.0 at this time. The fix will be included in OpenSSL 1.1.0h when it becomes available.

Specifically, this affects shadow 4.8 when compiled using --with-libpam but without explicitly passing --disable-account-tools-setuid, and without a PAM configuration suitable for use with setuid account management tools. This combination leads to account management tools (groupadd, groupdel, groupmod, useradd, userdel, usermod) that can easily be used by unprivileged local users to escalate privileges to root in multiple ways.

The amount of resources required for such an attack would be significant. However, for an attack on TLS to be meaningful, the server would have to share the DH1024 private key among multiple clients, which is no longer an option since CVE-2016-0701.

The vulnerability lies when multiply threads are handling large amounts of data. In both cases there is essentially a race condition that occurs. For the Heap-Buffer-Overflow, Thread 2 is creating the size for a buffer, but Thread1 is already writing to the buffer without knowing how much to write. So when a large amount of data is being processed, it is very easy to cause memory corruption using a Heap-Buffer-Overflow. As for the Use-After-Free, Thread3->Malloc->Thread1->Free's->Thread2-Re-uses-Free'd Memory.

The attacker can corrupt malloc metadata after the allocated buffer.","Severity":"CRITICAL","References":["http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/wget.git/commit/?id=ba6b44f6745b14dce414761a8e4b35d31b176bba","http://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2017-13090.html","http://linux.oracle.com/errata/ELSA-2017-3075.html","http://www.debian.org/security/2017/dsa-4008","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/101590","http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1039661","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:3075","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-13090","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201711-06","https://www.synology.com/support/security/Synology_SA_17_62_Wget","https://www.viestintavirasto.fi/en/cybersecurity/vulnerabilities/2017/haavoittuvuus-2017-037.html"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2019-5953","PkgName":"wget","InstalledVersion":"1.16-1+deb8u1","FixedVersion":"1.16-1+deb8u6","Title":"wget: do_conversion() heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability","Description":"Buffer overflow in GNU Wget 1.20.1 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial-of-service (DoS) or may execute an arbitrary code via unspecified vectors.","Severity":"HIGH","References":["http://jvn.jp/en/jp/JVN25261088/index.html","http://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2019-5953.html","http://linux.oracle.com/errata/ELSA-2019-1228.html","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-5953","https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K14560101","https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2016-7098","PkgName":"wget","InstalledVersion":"1.16-1+deb8u1","FixedVersion":"1.16-1+deb8u7","Title":"wget: files rejected by access list are kept on the disk for the duration of HTTP connection","Description":"Race condition in wget 1.17 and earlier, when used in recursive or mirroring mode to download a single file, might allow remote servers to bypass intended access list restrictions by keeping an HTTP connection open.","Severity":"MEDIUM","References":["http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-wget/2016-08/msg00083.html","http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-wget/2016-08/msg00134.html","http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-updates/2016-09/msg00044.html","http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-updates/2017-01/msg00007.html","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2016/08/27/2","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/93157","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-7098","https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/40824/"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2017-6508","PkgName":"wget","InstalledVersion":"1.16-1+deb8u1","FixedVersion":"1.16-1+deb8u2","Title":"wget: CRLF injection in the url_parse function in url.c","Description":"CRLF injection vulnerability in the url_parse function in url.c in Wget through 1.19.1 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary HTTP headers via CRLF sequences in the host subcomponent of a URL.","Severity":"MEDIUM","References":["http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/wget.git/commit/?id=4d729e322fae359a1aefaafec1144764a54e8ad4","http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-wget/2017-03/msg00018.html","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/96877","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-6508","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201706-16"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2018-0494","PkgName":"wget","InstalledVersion":"1.16-1+deb8u1","FixedVersion":"1.16-1+deb8u5","Title":"wget: Cookie injection allows malicious website to write arbitrary cookie entries into cookie jar","Description":"GNU Wget before 1.19.5 is prone to a cookie injection vulnerability in the resp_new function in http.c via a \\r\\n sequence in a continuation line.","Severity":"MEDIUM","References":["http://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2018-0494.html","http://linux.oracle.com/errata/ELSA-2018-3052.html","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/104129","http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1040838","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:3052","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-0494","https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/wget.git/commit/?id=1fc9c95ec144499e69dc8ec76dbe07799d7d82cd","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2018/05/msg00006.html","https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-wget/2018-05/msg00020.html","https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?53763","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201806-01","https://sintonen.fi/advisories/gnu-wget-cookie-injection.txt","https://usn.ubuntu.com/3643-1/","https://usn.ubuntu.com/3643-2/","https://www.debian.org/security/2018/dsa-4195","https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/44601/"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2017-15131","PkgName":"xdg-user-dirs","InstalledVersion":"0.15-2","Title":"xdg-user-dirs, gnome-session: Xsession creation of XDG user directories does not honor system umask policy","Description":"It was found that system umask policy is not being honored when creating XDG user directories, since Xsession sources xdg-user-dirs.sh before setting umask policy.
