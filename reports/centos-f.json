By default, if Bash is run with its effective UID not equal to its real UID, it will drop privileges by setting its effective UID to its real UID. However, it does so incorrectly. On Linux and other systems that support \"saved UID\" functionality, the saved UID is not dropped. An attacker with command execution in the shell can use \"enable -f\" for runtime loading of a new builtin, which can be a shared object that calls setuid() and therefore regains privileges. However, binaries running with an effective UID of 0 are unaffected.","Severity":"HIGH","References":["http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/155498/Bash-5.0-Patch-11-Privilege-Escalation.html","https://github.com/bminor/bash/commit/951bdaad7a18cc0dc1036bba86b18b90874d39ff","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wGtxJ8opa8"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2019-6477","PkgName":"bind-export-libs","InstalledVersion":"32:9.11.4-26.P2.el8","Title":"bind: TCP Pipelining doesn't limit TCP clients on a single connection","Description":"With pipelining enabled each incoming query on a TCP connection requires a similar resource allocation to a query received via UDP or via TCP without pipelining enabled.

In those cases it is possible that such a group does not have the cofactor present. This can occur even where all the parameters match a known named curve. If such a curve is used then OpenSSL falls back to non-side channel resistant code paths which may result in full key recovery during an ECDSA signature operation. In order to be vulnerable an attacker would have to have the ability to time the creation of a large number of signatures where explicit parameters with no co-factor present are in use by an application using libcrypto. For the avoidance of doubt libssl is not vulnerable because explicit parameters are never used. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1d (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1c). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.0l (Affected 1.1.0-1.1.0k).
