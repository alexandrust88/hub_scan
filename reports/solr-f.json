If an attacker underflows the 'num' parameter to memcpy(), this vulnerability could lead to undefined behavior such as writing to out-of-bounds memory and potentially remote code execution. Furthermore, this memcpy() implementation allows for program execution to continue in scenarios where a segmentation fault or crash should have occurred. The dangers occur in that subsequent execution and iterations of this code will be executed with this corrupted data.","Severity":"HIGH","References":["https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=25620"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2010-4051","PkgName":"libc6","InstalledVersion":"2.28-10","Title":"CVE-2010-4052 glibc: De-recursivise regular expression engine","Description":"The regcomp implementation in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) through 2.11.3, and 2.12.x through 2.12.2, allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a regular expression containing adjacent bounded repetitions that bypass the intended RE_DUP_MAX limitation, as demonstrated by a {10,}{10,}{10,}{10,}{10,} sequence in the proftpd.gnu.c exploit for ProFTPD, related to a \"RE_DUP_MAX overflow.\"","Severity":"MEDIUM","References":["http://cxib.net/stuff/proftpd.gnu.c","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2011/Jan/78","http://secunia.com/advisories/42547","http://securityreason.com/achievement_securityalert/93","http://securityreason.com/securityalert/8003","http://securitytracker.com/id?1024832","http://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/15935","http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/912279","http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/515589/100/0/threaded","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/45233","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=645859"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2010-4052","PkgName":"libc6","InstalledVersion":"2.28-10","Title":"CVE-2010-4051 CVE-2010-4052 glibc: De-recursivise regular expression engine","Description":"Stack consumption vulnerability in the regcomp implementation in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) through 2.11.3, and 2.12.x through 2.12.2, allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (resource exhaustion) via a regular expression containing adjacent repetition operators, as demonstrated by a {10,}{10,}{10,}{10,} sequence in the proftpd.gnu.c exploit for ProFTPD.","Severity":"MEDIUM","References":["http://cxib.net/stuff/proftpd.gnu.c","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2011/Jan/78","http://secunia.com/advisories/42547","http://securityreason.com/achievement_securityalert/93","http://securityreason.com/securityalert/8003","http://securitytracker.com/id?1024832","http://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/15935","http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/912279","http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/515589/100/0/threaded","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/45233","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=645859"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2010-4756","PkgName":"libc6","InstalledVersion":"2.28-10","Title":"glibc: glob implementation can cause excessive CPU and memory consumption due to crafted glob expressions","Description":"The glob implementation in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (CPU and memory consumption) via crafted glob expressions that do not match any pathnames, as demonstrated by glob expressions in STAT commands to an FTP daemon, a different vulnerability than CVE-2010-2632.","Severity":"MEDIUM","References":["http://cxib.net/stuff/glob-0day.c","http://securityreason.com/achievement_securityalert/89","http://securityreason.com/exploitalert/9223"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2016-10228","PkgName":"libc6","InstalledVersion":"2.28-10","Title":"glibc: iconv program can hang when invoked with the -c option","Description":"The iconv program in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) 2.25 and earlier, when invoked with the -c option, enters an infinite loop when processing invalid multi-byte input sequences, leading to a denial of service.","Severity":"MEDIUM","References":["http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2017/03/01/10","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/96525","https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=19519"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2018-20796","PkgName":"libc6","InstalledVersion":"2.28-10","Title":"glibc: uncontrolled recursion in function check_dst_limits_calc_pos_1 in posix/regexec.c","Description":"In the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) through 2.29, check_dst_limits_calc_pos_1 in posix/regexec.c has Uncontrolled Recursion, as demonstrated by '(\\227|)(\\\\1\\\\1|t1|\\\\\\2537)+' in grep.","Severity":"MEDIUM","References":["http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/107160","https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=34141","https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gnulib/2019-01/msg00108.html","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20190315-0002/","https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K26346590?utm_source=f5support&amp;utm_medium=RSS"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2019-1010023","PkgName":"libc6","InstalledVersion":"2.28-10","Title":"glibc: running ldd on malicious ELF leads to code execution because of wrong size computation","Description":"GNU Libc current is affected by: Re-mapping current loaded libray with malicious ELF file.
