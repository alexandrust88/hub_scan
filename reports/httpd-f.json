This allows an attacker to remove themselves from a supplementary group, which may allow access to certain filesystem paths if the administrator has used \"group blacklisting\" (e.g., chmod g-rwx) to restrict access to paths. This flaw effectively reverts a security feature in the kernel (in particular, the /proc/self/setgroups knob) to prevent this sort of privilege escalation.","Severity":"MEDIUM","References":["https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/shadow/+bug/1729357","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201805-09"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2019-19882","PkgName":"passwd","InstalledVersion":"1:4.5-1.1","Title":"shadow-utils: local users can obtain root access because setuid programs are misconfigured","Description":"shadow 4.8, in certain circumstances affecting at least Gentoo, Arch Linux, and Void Linux, allows local users to obtain root access because setuid programs are misconfigured. Specifically, this affects shadow 4.8 when compiled using --with-libpam but without explicitly passing --disable-account-tools-setuid, and without a PAM configuration suitable for use with setuid account management tools. This combination leads to account management tools (groupadd, groupdel, groupmod, useradd, userdel, usermod) that can easily be used by unprivileged local users to escalate privileges to root in multiple ways. This issue became much more relevant in approximately December 2019 when an unrelated bug was fixed (i.e., the chmod calls to suidusbins were fixed in the upstream Makefile which is now included in the release version 4.8).","Severity":"MEDIUM","References":["https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/64836","https://bugs.gentoo.org/702252","https://github.com/shadow-maint/shadow/commit/edf7547ad5aa650be868cf2dac58944773c12d75","https://github.com/shadow-maint/shadow/pull/199","https://github.com/void-linux/void-packages/pull/17580"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2013-4235","PkgName":"passwd","InstalledVersion":"1:4.5-1.1","Title":"shadow-utils: TOCTOU race conditions by copying and removing directory trees","Description":"shadow: TOCTOU (time-of-check time-of-use) race condition when copying and removing directory trees","Severity":"LOW","References":["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2013-4235","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2013-4235","https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-4235"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"TEMP-0628843-DBAD28","PkgName":"passwd","InstalledVersion":"1:4.5-1.1","Severity":"LOW"},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2011-4116","PkgName":"perl-base","InstalledVersion":"5.28.1-6","Title":"perl: File::Temp insecure temporary file handling","Description":"_is_safe in the File::Temp module for Perl does not properly handle symlinks.","Severity":"MEDIUM","References":["http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2011/11/04/2","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2011/11/04/4","https://github.com/Perl-Toolchain-Gang/File-Temp/issues/14","https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=69106","https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2011/q4/238"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"TEMP-0517018-A83CE6","PkgName":"sysvinit-utils","InstalledVersion":"2.93-8","Severity":"LOW"},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2005-2541","PkgName":"tar","InstalledVersion":"1.30+dfsg-6","Description":"Tar 1.15.1 does not properly warn the user when extracting setuid or setgid files, which may allow local users or remote attackers to gain privileges.","Severity":"CRITICAL","References":["http://marc.info/?l=bugtraq&m=112327628230258&w=2"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2019-9923","PkgName":"tar","InstalledVersion":"1.30+dfsg-6","Title":"tar: null-pointer dereference in pax_decode_header in sparse.c","Description":"pax_decode_header in sparse.c in GNU Tar before 1.32 had a NULL pointer dereference when parsing certain archives that have malformed extended headers.","Severity":"MEDIUM","References":["http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/tar.git/commit/?id=cb07844454d8cc9fb21f53ace75975f91185a120","http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-04/msg00077.html","http://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?55369","https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/tar/+bug/1810241"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"TEMP-0290435-0B57B5","PkgName":"tar","InstalledVersion":"1.30+dfsg-6","Severity":"LOW"}]}
