Git uses external \"credential helper\" programs to store and retrieve passwords or other credentials from secure storage provided by the operating system. Specially-crafted URLs that contain an encoded newline can inject unintended values into the credential helper protocol stream, causing the credential helper to retrieve the password for one server (e.g., good.example.com) for an HTTP request being made to another server (e.g., evil.example.com), resulting in credentials for the former being sent to the latter. There are no restrictions on the relationship between the two, meaning that an attacker can craft a URL that will present stored credentials for any host to a host of their choosing. The vulnerability can be triggered by feeding a malicious URL to git clone. However, the affected URLs look rather suspicious; the likely vector would be through systems which automatically clone URLs not visible to the user, such as Git submodules, or package systems built around Git. The problem has been patched in the versions published on April 14th, 2020, going back to v2.17.x. Anyone wishing to backport the change further can do so by applying commit 9a6bbee (the full release includes extra checks for git fsck, but that commit is sufficient to protect clients against the vulnerability). The patched versions are: 2.17.4, 2.18.3, 2.19.4, 2.20.3, 2.21.2, 2.22.3, 2.23.2, 2.24.2, 2.25.3, 2.26.1.","Severity":"HIGH","References":["http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/157250/Git-Credential-Helper-Protocol-Newline-Injection.html","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2020/04/15/5","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-5260","https://github.com/git/git/commit/9a6bbee8006c24b46a85d29e7b38cfa79e9ab21b","https://github.com/git/git/security/advisories/GHSA-qm7j-c969-7j4q","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2020/04/msg00010.html","https://lore.kernel.org/git/xmqqy2qy7xn8.fsf@gitster.c.googlers.com/","https://www.debian.org/security/2020/dsa-4657"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2017-15298","PkgName":"git","InstalledVersion":"1:2.11.0-3+deb9u3","Title":"git: Mishandling layers of tree objects","Description":"Git through 2.14.2 mishandles layers of tree objects, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via a crafted repository, aka a Git bomb.

Git uses external \"credential helper\" programs to store and retrieve passwords or other credentials from secure storage provided by the operating system. Specially-crafted URLs that contain an encoded newline can inject unintended values into the credential helper protocol stream, causing the credential helper to retrieve the password for one server (e.g., good.example.com) for an HTTP request being made to another server (e.g., evil.example.com), resulting in credentials for the former being sent to the latter. There are no restrictions on the relationship between the two, meaning that an attacker can craft a URL that will present stored credentials for any host to a host of their choosing. The vulnerability can be triggered by feeding a malicious URL to git clone. However, the affected URLs look rather suspicious; the likely vector would be through systems which automatically clone URLs not visible to the user, such as Git submodules, or package systems built around Git. The problem has been patched in the versions published on April 14th, 2020, going back to v2.17.x. Anyone wishing to backport the change further can do so by applying commit 9a6bbee (the full release includes extra checks for git fsck, but that commit is sufficient to protect clients against the vulnerability). The patched versions are: 2.17.4, 2.18.3, 2.19.4, 2.20.3, 2.21.2, 2.22.3, 2.23.2, 2.24.2, 2.25.3, 2.26.1.","Severity":"HIGH","References":["http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/157250/Git-Credential-Helper-Protocol-Newline-Injection.html","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2020/04/15/5","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-5260","https://github.com/git/git/commit/9a6bbee8006c24b46a85d29e7b38cfa79e9ab21b","https://github.com/git/git/security/advisories/GHSA-qm7j-c969-7j4q","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2020/04/msg00010.html","https://lore.kernel.org/git/xmqqy2qy7xn8.fsf@gitster.c.googlers.com/","https://www.debian.org/security/2020/dsa-4657"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2017-15298","PkgName":"git-man","InstalledVersion":"1:2.11.0-3+deb9u3","Title":"git: Mishandling layers of tree objects","Description":"Git through 2.14.2 mishandles layers of tree objects, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via a crafted repository, aka a Git bomb.

The internal function Curl_ntlm_core_mk_nt_hash multiplies the length of the password by two (SUM) to figure out how large temporary storage area to allocate from the heap. The length value is then subsequently used to iterate over the password and generate output into the allocated storage buffer. On systems with a 32 bit size_t, the math to calculate SUM triggers an integer overflow when the password length exceeds 2GB (2^31 bytes). This integer overflow usually causes a very small buffer to actually get allocated instead of the intended very huge one, making the use of that buffer end up in a heap buffer overflow.

Python versions prior to 2.7.14 may also be vulnerable and it appears that Python 2.7.17 and prior may also be vulnerable however this has not been confirmed. The vulnerability lies when multiply threads are handling large amounts of data. In both cases there is essentially a race condition that occurs. For the Heap-Buffer-Overflow, Thread 2 is creating the size for a buffer, but Thread1 is already writing to the buffer without knowing how much to write. So when a large amount of data is being processed, it is very easy to cause memory corruption using a Heap-Buffer-Overflow. As for the Use-After-Free, Thread3->Malloc->Thread1->Free's->Thread2-Re-uses-Free'd Memory. The PSRT has stated that this is not a security vulnerability due to the fact that the attacker must be able to run code, however in some situations, such as function as a service, this vulnerability can potentially be used by an attacker to violate a trust boundary, as such the DWF feels this issue deserves a CVE.","Severity":"LOW","References":["https://bugs.python.org/issue31530","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1000030","https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oyR9DAZjZK_SCn3mor6NRAYLJS6ueXaY/view","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201811-02","https://usn.ubuntu.com/3817-1/","https://usn.ubuntu.com/3817-2/","https://www.dropbox.com/sh/sj3ee7xv55j36k7/AADwP-YfOYikBMuy32e0uvPFa?dl=0","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2020.html"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2018-1000802","PkgName":"libpython2.7-stdlib","InstalledVersion":"2.7.13-2+deb9u2","FixedVersion":"2.7.13-2+deb9u3","Title":"python: Command injection in the shutil module","Description":"Python Software Foundation Python (CPython) version 2.7 contains a CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection') vulnerability in shutil module (make_archive function) that can result in Denial of service, Information gain via injection of arbitrary files on the system or entire drive.

Python versions prior to 2.7.14 may also be vulnerable and it appears that Python 2.7.17 and prior may also be vulnerable however this has not been confirmed. The vulnerability lies when multiply threads are handling large amounts of data. In both cases there is essentially a race condition that occurs. For the Heap-Buffer-Overflow, Thread 2 is creating the size for a buffer, but Thread1 is already writing to the buffer without knowing how much to write. So when a large amount of data is being processed, it is very easy to cause memory corruption using a Heap-Buffer-Overflow. As for the Use-After-Free, Thread3->Malloc->Thread1->Free's->Thread2-Re-uses-Free'd Memory. The PSRT has stated that this is not a security vulnerability due to the fact that the attacker must be able to run code, however in some situations, such as function as a service, this vulnerability can potentially be used by an attacker to violate a trust boundary, as such the DWF feels this issue deserves a CVE.","Severity":"LOW","References":["https://bugs.python.org/issue31530","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1000030","https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oyR9DAZjZK_SCn3mor6NRAYLJS6ueXaY/view","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201811-02","https://usn.ubuntu.com/3817-1/","https://usn.ubuntu.com/3817-2/","https://www.dropbox.com/sh/sj3ee7xv55j36k7/AADwP-YfOYikBMuy32e0uvPFa?dl=0","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2020.html"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2017-11464","PkgName":"librsvg2-2","InstalledVersion":"2.40.16-1","Title":"librsvg: SIGFPE is raised in box_blur_line function of rsvg-filter.c","Description":"A SIGFPE is raised in the function box_blur_line of rsvg-filter.c in GNOME librsvg 2.40.17 during an attempted parse of a crafted SVG file, because of incorrect protection against division by zero.","Severity":"MEDIUM","References":["http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/99956","https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=783835","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-11464","https://git.gnome.org/browse/librsvg/commit/?id=ecf9267a24b2c3c0cd211dbdfa9ef2232511972a","https://github.com/GNOME/librsvg/commit/ecf9267a24b2c3c0cd211dbdfa9ef2232511972a"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2019-20446","PkgName":"librsvg2-2","InstalledVersion":"2.40.16-1","Title":"librsvg: Resource exhaustion via crafted SVG file with nested patterns","Description":"In xml.rs in GNOME librsvg before 2.46.2, a crafted SVG file with nested patterns can cause denial of service when passed to the library for processing.

RFC 7539 specifies that the nonce value (IV) should be 96 bits (12 bytes). OpenSSL allows a variable nonce length and front pads the nonce with 0 bytes if it is less than 12 bytes. However it also incorrectly allows a nonce to be set of up to 16 bytes. In this case only the last 12 bytes are significant and any additional leading bytes are ignored. It is a requirement of using this cipher that nonce values are unique. Messages encrypted using a reused nonce value are susceptible to serious confidentiality and integrity attacks. If an application changes the default nonce length to be longer than 12 bytes and then makes a change to the leading bytes of the nonce expecting the new value to be a new unique nonce then such an application could inadvertently encrypt messages with a reused nonce. Additionally the ignored bytes in a long nonce are not covered by the integrity guarantee of this cipher. Any application that relies on the integrity of these ignored leading bytes of a long nonce may be further affected. Any OpenSSL internal use of this cipher, including in SSL/TLS, is safe because no such use sets such a long nonce value. However user applications that use this cipher directly and set a non-default nonce length to be longer than 12 bytes may be vulnerable. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1 and 1.1.0 are affected by this issue. Due to the limited scope of affected deployments this has been assessed as low severity and therefore we are not creating new releases at this time. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1c (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1b).

RFC 7539 specifies that the nonce value (IV) should be 96 bits (12 bytes). OpenSSL allows a variable nonce length and front pads the nonce with 0 bytes if it is less than 12 bytes. However it also incorrectly allows a nonce to be set of up to 16 bytes. In this case only the last 12 bytes are significant and any additional leading bytes are ignored. It is a requirement of using this cipher that nonce values are unique. Messages encrypted using a reused nonce value are susceptible to serious confidentiality and integrity attacks. If an application changes the default nonce length to be longer than 12 bytes and then makes a change to the leading bytes of the nonce expecting the new value to be a new unique nonce then such an application could inadvertently encrypt messages with a reused nonce. Additionally the ignored bytes in a long nonce are not covered by the integrity guarantee of this cipher. Any application that relies on the integrity of these ignored leading bytes of a long nonce may be further affected. Any OpenSSL internal use of this cipher, including in SSL/TLS, is safe because no such use sets such a long nonce value. However user applications that use this cipher directly and set a non-default nonce length to be longer than 12 bytes may be vulnerable. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1 and 1.1.0 are affected by this issue. Due to the limited scope of affected deployments this has been assessed as low severity and therefore we are not creating new releases at this time. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1c (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1b).

Python versions prior to 2.7.14 may also be vulnerable and it appears that Python 2.7.17 and prior may also be vulnerable however this has not been confirmed. The vulnerability lies when multiply threads are handling large amounts of data. In both cases there is essentially a race condition that occurs. For the Heap-Buffer-Overflow, Thread 2 is creating the size for a buffer, but Thread1 is already writing to the buffer without knowing how much to write. So when a large amount of data is being processed, it is very easy to cause memory corruption using a Heap-Buffer-Overflow. As for the Use-After-Free, Thread3->Malloc->Thread1->Free's->Thread2-Re-uses-Free'd Memory. The PSRT has stated that this is not a security vulnerability due to the fact that the attacker must be able to run code, however in some situations, such as function as a service, this vulnerability can potentially be used by an attacker to violate a trust boundary, as such the DWF feels this issue deserves a CVE.","Severity":"LOW","References":["https://bugs.python.org/issue31530","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1000030","https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oyR9DAZjZK_SCn3mor6NRAYLJS6ueXaY/view","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201811-02","https://usn.ubuntu.com/3817-1/","https://usn.ubuntu.com/3817-2/","https://www.dropbox.com/sh/sj3ee7xv55j36k7/AADwP-YfOYikBMuy32e0uvPFa?dl=0","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2020.html"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2018-11782","PkgName":"subversion","InstalledVersion":"1.9.5-1+deb9u2","FixedVersion":"1.9.5-1+deb9u4","Title":"subversion: remotely triggerable DoS vulnerability in svnserve 'get-deleted-rev'","Description":"In Apache Subversion versions up to and including 1.9.10, 1.10.4, 1.12.0, Subversion's svnserve server process may exit when a well-formed read-only request produces a particular answer.
