Git uses external \"credential helper\" programs to store and retrieve passwords or other credentials from secure storage provided by the operating system. Specially-crafted URLs that contain an encoded newline can inject unintended values into the credential helper protocol stream, causing the credential helper to retrieve the password for one server (e.g., good.example.com) for an HTTP request being made to another server (e.g., evil.example.com), resulting in credentials for the former being sent to the latter. There are no restrictions on the relationship between the two, meaning that an attacker can craft a URL that will present stored credentials for any host to a host of their choosing. The vulnerability can be triggered by feeding a malicious URL to git clone. However, the affected URLs look rather suspicious; the likely vector would be through systems which automatically clone URLs not visible to the user, such as Git submodules, or package systems built around Git. The problem has been patched in the versions published on April 14th, 2020, going back to v2.17.x. Anyone wishing to backport the change further can do so by applying commit 9a6bbee (the full release includes extra checks for git fsck, but that commit is sufficient to protect clients against the vulnerability).

Git uses external \"credential helper\" programs to store and retrieve passwords or other credentials from secure storage provided by the operating system. Specially-crafted URLs that contain an encoded newline can inject unintended values into the credential helper protocol stream, causing the credential helper to retrieve the password for one server (e.g., good.example.com) for an HTTP request being made to another server (e.g., evil.example.com), resulting in credentials for the former being sent to the latter. There are no restrictions on the relationship between the two, meaning that an attacker can craft a URL that will present stored credentials for any host to a host of their choosing. The vulnerability can be triggered by feeding a malicious URL to git clone. However, the affected URLs look rather suspicious; the likely vector would be through systems which automatically clone URLs not visible to the user, such as Git submodules, or package systems built around Git. The problem has been patched in the versions published on April 14th, 2020, going back to v2.17.x. Anyone wishing to backport the change further can do so by applying commit 9a6bbee (the full release includes extra checks for git fsck, but that commit is sufficient to protect clients against the vulnerability).

In fixed versions, jQuery only deems the input to be HTML if it explicitly starts with the '<' character, limiting exploitability only to attackers who can control the beginning of a string, which is far less common.","Severity":"MEDIUM","References":["http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/153237/RetireJS-CORS-Issue-Script-Execution.html","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/102792","https://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11290","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-6708","https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/05531fc4080ae24070930d15ae0cea7ae056457d","https://help.ecostruxureit.com/display/public/UADCE725/Security+fixes+in+StruxureWare+Data+Center+Expert+v7.6.0","https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:jquery:20120206"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2015-9251","PkgName":"libjs-jquery","InstalledVersion":"1.7.2+dfsg-3.2","Title":"js-jquery: Cross-site scripting via cross-domain ajax requests","Description":"jQuery before 3.0.0 is vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks when a cross-domain Ajax request is performed without the dataType option, causing text/javascript responses to be executed.","Severity":"MEDIUM","References":["http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/152787/dotCMS-5.1.1-Vulnerable-Dependencies.html","http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/153237/RetireJS-CORS-Issue-Script-Execution.html","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2019/May/10","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2019/May/11","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2019/May/13","http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpuoct2018-4428296.html","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105658","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-9251","https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/f60729f3903d17917dc351f3ac87794de379b0cc","https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/2432","https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/2588","https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/2588/commits/c254d308a7d3f1eac4d0b42837804cfffcba4bb2","https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/advisories/ICSA-18-212-04","https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/May/18","https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:jquery:20150627","https://sw.aveva.com/hubfs/assets-2018/pdf/security-bulletin/SecurityBulletin_LFSec126.pdf","https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpuapr2019-5072813.html","https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpujan2019-5072801.html"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2017-11462","PkgName":"libk5crypto3","InstalledVersion":"1.12.1+dfsg-19+deb8u4","Title":"krb5: Automatic sec context deletion could lead to double-free","Description":"Double free vulnerability in MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) allows attackers to have unspecified impact via vectors involving automatic deletion of security contexts on error.","Severity":"HIGH","References":["http://krbdev.mit.edu/rt/Ticket/Display.html?id=8598","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1488873","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-11462","https://github.com/krb5/krb5/commit/56f7b1bc95a2a3eeb420e069e7655fb181ade5cf","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/2FPRUP4YVOEBGEROUYWZFEQ64HTMGNED/"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2017-15088","PkgName":"libk5crypto3","InstalledVersion":"1.12.1+dfsg-19+deb8u4","Title":"krb5: Buffer overflow in get_matching_data()","Description":"plugins/preauth/pkinit/pkinit_crypto_openssl.c in MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) through 1.15.2 mishandles Distinguished Name (DN) fields, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (buffer overflow and application crash) in situations involving untrusted X.509 data, related to the get_matching_data and X509_NAME_oneline_ex functions.

Python versions prior to 2.7.14 may also be vulnerable and it appears that Python 2.7.17 and prior may also be vulnerable however this has not been confirmed. The vulnerability lies when multiply threads are handling large amounts of data. In both cases there is essentially a race condition that occurs. For the Heap-Buffer-Overflow, Thread 2 is creating the size for a buffer, but Thread1 is already writing to the buffer without knowing how much to write. So when a large amount of data is being processed, it is very easy to cause memory corruption using a Heap-Buffer-Overflow. As for the Use-After-Free, Thread3->Malloc->Thread1->Free's->Thread2-Re-uses-Free'd Memory. The PSRT has stated that this is not a security vulnerability due to the fact that the attacker must be able to run code, however in some situations, such as function as a service, this vulnerability can potentially be used by an attacker to violate a trust boundary, as such the DWF feels this issue deserves a CVE.","Severity":"LOW","References":["https://bugs.python.org/issue31530","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1000030","https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oyR9DAZjZK_SCn3mor6NRAYLJS6ueXaY/view","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201811-02","https://usn.ubuntu.com/3817-1/","https://usn.ubuntu.com/3817-2/","https://www.dropbox.com/sh/sj3ee7xv55j36k7/AADwP-YfOYikBMuy32e0uvPFa?dl=0","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2020.html"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2015-5276","PkgName":"libquadmath0","InstalledVersion":"4.9.2-10+deb8u1","Title":"gcc: Predictable randomness from std::random_device","Description":"The std::random_device class in libstdc++ in the GNU Compiler Collection (aka GCC) before 4.9.4 does not properly handle short reads from blocking sources, which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to predict the random values via unspecified vectors.","Severity":"MEDIUM","References":["http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-updates/2015-11/msg00054.html","http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-updates/2016-04/msg00052.html","http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1034375","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1262846","https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=65142"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2018-12886","PkgName":"libquadmath0","InstalledVersion":"4.9.2-10+deb8u1","Title":"gcc: spilling of stack protection address in cfgexpand.c and function.c leads to stack-overflow protection bypass","Description":"stack_protect_prologue in cfgexpand.c and stack_protect_epilogue in function.c in GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) 4.1 through 8 (under certain circumstances) generate instruction sequences when targeting ARM targets that spill the address of the stack protector guard, which allows an attacker to bypass the protection of -fstack-protector, -fstack-protector-all, -fstack-protector-strong, and -fstack-protector-explicit against stack overflow by controlling what the stack canary is compared against.","Severity":"MEDIUM","References":["https://gcc.gnu.org/viewcvs/gcc/trunk/gcc/config/arm/arm-protos.h?revision=266379&view=markup","https://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/gcc-8/changes.html"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2017-11671","PkgName":"libquadmath0","InstalledVersion":"4.9.2-10+deb8u1","Title":"gcc: GCC generates incorrect code for RDRAND/RDSEED intrinsics","Description":"Under certain circumstances, the ix86_expand_builtin function in i386.c in GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) version 4.6, 4.7, 4.8, 4.9, 5 before 5.5, and 6 before 6.4 will generate instruction sequences that clobber the status flag of the RDRAND and RDSEED intrinsics before it can be read, potentially causing failures of these instructions to go unreported.

However, in some cases, it is possible to construct a group using explicit parameters (instead of using a named curve). In those cases it is possible that such a group does not have the cofactor present. This can occur even where all the parameters match a known named curve. If such a curve is used then OpenSSL falls back to non-side channel resistant code paths which may result in full key recovery during an ECDSA signature operation. In order to be vulnerable an attacker would have to have the ability to time the creation of a large number of signatures where explicit parameters with no co-factor present are in use by an application using libcrypto.

If such a curve is used then OpenSSL falls back to non-side channel resistant code paths which may result in full key recovery during an ECDSA signature operation. In order to be vulnerable an attacker would have to have the ability to time the creation of a large number of signatures where explicit parameters with no co-factor present are in use by an application using libcrypto.

Specifically, it is possible to extract the KASLR kernel image offset using the IP ID values the kernel produces for connection-less protocols (e.g., UDP and ICMP). When such traffic is sent to multiple destination IP addresses, it is possible to obtain hash collisions (of indices to the counter array) and thereby obtain the hashing key (via enumeration). This key contains enough bits from a kernel address (of a static variable) so when the key is extracted (via enumeration), the offset of the kernel image is exposed. This attack can be carried out remotely, by the attacker forcing the target device to send UDP or ICMP (or certain other) traffic to attacker-controlled IP addresses. Forcing a server to send UDP traffic is trivial if the server is a DNS server. ICMP traffic is trivial if the server answers ICMP Echo requests (ping). For client targets, if the target visits the attacker's web page, then WebRTC or gQUIC can be used to force UDP traffic to attacker-controlled IP addresses. NOTE: this attack against KASLR became viable in 4.1 because IP ID generation was changed to have a dependency on an address associated with a network namespace.","Severity":"MEDIUM","References":["http://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2019-10639.html","http://linux.oracle.com/errata/ELSA-2020-1016.html","http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-07/msg00014.html","http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-07/msg00025.html","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.10478.pdf","https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v5.x/ChangeLog-5.0.8","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-10639","https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=355b98553789b646ed97ad801a619ff898471b92","https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/355b98553789b646ed97ad801a619ff898471b92","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2019/07/msg00022.html"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2019-11091","PkgName":"linux-libc-dev","InstalledVersion":"3.16.59-1","FixedVersion":"3.16.68-1","Title":"hardware: Microarchitectural Data Sampling Uncacheable Memory (MDSUM)","Description":"Microarchitectural Data Sampling Uncacheable Memory (MDSUM): Uncacheable memory on some microprocessors utilizing speculative execution may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable information disclosure via a side channel with local access.

For the Heap-Buffer-Overflow, Thread 2 is creating the size for a buffer, but Thread1 is already writing to the buffer without knowing how much to write.

Python versions prior to 2.7.14 may also be vulnerable and it appears that Python 2.7.17 and prior may also be vulnerable however this has not been confirmed. The vulnerability lies when multiply threads are handling large amounts of data. In both cases there is essentially a race condition that occurs. For the Heap-Buffer-Overflow, Thread 2 is creating the size for a buffer, but Thread1 is already writing to the buffer without knowing how much to write. So when a large amount of data is being processed, it is very easy to cause memory corruption using a Heap-Buffer-Overflow. As for the Use-After-Free, Thread3->Malloc->Thread1->Free's->Thread2-Re-uses-Free'd Memory. The PSRT has stated that this is not a security vulnerability due to the fact that the attacker must be able to run code, however in some situations, such as function as a service, this vulnerability can potentially be used by an attacker to violate a trust boundary, as such the DWF feels this issue deserves a CVE.","Severity":"LOW","References":["https://bugs.python.org/issue31530","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1000030","https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oyR9DAZjZK_SCn3mor6NRAYLJS6ueXaY/view","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201811-02","https://usn.ubuntu.com/3817-1/","https://usn.ubuntu.com/3817-2/","https://www.dropbox.com/sh/sj3ee7xv55j36k7/AADwP-YfOYikBMuy32e0uvPFa?dl=0","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2020.html"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2018-11782","PkgName":"subversion","InstalledVersion":"1.8.10-6+deb8u6","FixedVersion":"1.8.10-6+deb8u7","Title":"subversion: remotely triggerable DoS vulnerability in svnserve 'get-deleted-rev'","Description":"In Apache Subversion versions up to and including 1.9.10, 1.10.4, 1.12.0, Subversion's svnserve server process may exit when a well-formed read-only request produces a particular answer.
